# Mission 2 â€” Patch the Wormhole

The alien payload `' OR '1'='1` is ripping through unsecured query strings. Mission 2 focuses on spotting and sealing the breach before more agent intel leaks.

## Mission Snapshot

- **Primary Goal:** Identify the vulnerable login path and neutralize the SQL injection tunnel.
- **Key Actions:** Reproduce the exploit, replace unsafe string concatenation with parameterized statements, and harden your validation checks.
- **Win Condition:** Security scans confirm the wormhole is sealed, awarding Code Fragment **BRAVO-4M8Q**.

## Success Tips

- Treat every user input as hostile; sanitize it before it reaches the database layer.
- Log the before-and-after behavior to prove the fix actually blocks the payload.
- Rerun automated penetration tests after each change to verify the tunnel stays closed.
