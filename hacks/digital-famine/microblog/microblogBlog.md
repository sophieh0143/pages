# Submodule 4

# Microblogging System Overview

## What is the Microblog Feature?
The repository implements a modern microblogging system that allows users to engage in discussions through short messages on any page where it's enabled. It appears as a floating "ðŸ’¬ Microblog" button that opens a side panel for reading and posting messages.

## Key Components

1. **User Interface**
   - A floating "Microblog" button appears on enabled pages
   - Side panel overlay that slides in from the right
   - Mobile-friendly design that adapts to different screen sizes
   - Interactive form for creating and editing posts

2. **Architecture**
   The system is built with three main layers:

   - **Layout Layer** (`_layouts/opencs.html`)
     - Handles dependencies (Tailwind CSS, jQuery)
     - Creates the microblog overlay and button
     - Manages the overall UI structure

   - **JavaScript Layer** (`assets/js/api/microblog.js`)
     - Manages UI interactivity
     - Handles API communications
     - Processes posts, replies, and updates

   - **Backend Layer**
     - Provides RESTful API endpoints for:
       - Getting posts (`GET /microblog`)
       - Creating posts (`POST /microblog`)
       - Replying to posts (`POST /microblog/reply`)
       - Adding reactions (`POST /microblog/reaction`)

## How to Enable Microblogging

To add microblogging to any page, add this to your page's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
layout: post
microblog: True
title: Your Title
description: Your Description
permalink: /your-path
---
```

## Features
- Create and edit microblog posts
- View posts specific to the current page or all pages
- Real-time updates
- Mobile-responsive design
- User analytics (timestamp, character count)
- Topic-based organization
- Interactive UI with modern styling

The microblog system is designed to enhance engagement and communication within the site while maintaining a clean, unobtrusive user experience.
